Quick Start Guide for Git Workshop

Getting Started:
1) Register for a GitHub account at github.com
2) Install GitHub GUI. You can find this one your homepage after you login to your account at the bottom of the page under "Applications"
3) Set up your account information once you've first installed GitHub.

Making your first local repository (repo):
1) Go to the GitHub GUI Client application and click the "+add" button on the top (this is on Windows.. If you're on Mac, just find the add repository button somewhere).
2) Fill out the repository information. Think of this like you're making a new folder. Make sure to push the repository onto github so it's uploaded onto github's servers.
3) Make sure you remember where you are saving the repositories on your local machine. This is where you will put your files to upload eventually.
4) You should see the new repository under "local repository"

Yay you made it! 

Making your first commit:
1) Download the html file on davidnuon.com/git/demo
2) Put the html file that you downloaded into the local repository located wherever you created your repository at (it's usually defaulted to be in your Documents/GitHub folder).
3) Go back to GitHub Client Application and double click your repository. It should say "Uncommitted Changes." 
4) Describe your commit and click commit.

Yay you made it again!
