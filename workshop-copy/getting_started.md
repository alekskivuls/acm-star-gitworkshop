- While still signed in your new GitHub account (on github.com), scroll down to the footer and look for "Applications." Click the link that matches your operating system. For this workshop, we will be installing for Windows operating system. 
- Welcome Screen will appear (show screenshot).
- Go through configuration steps or set up account later.
- Yay! You are now ready to use GitHub!

### First Repository
You can think of repository like a box for your code. Git will keep track of this box for any changes and will notify you if there is a change. 

Add your first repository by clicking on the add button in GitHub.

Hurray! You have just created your first repo :D
Now add files to your repository and make your first commit.


### First Commit
When you install GitHub, it automatically makes a directory called "GitHub" probably in your Documents folder unless you specified it to be somewhere else. The GitHub folder will be where all your repositories sit. If you want to add files and folders into your repository, all you do is go to your Documents > GitHub directory and put the files in the repository folder (see picture below).

In our example above, we named our repository "acm-star-gitworkshop". We are now currently inside the repository directory. You can add files and edit files with your text editor from this directory.

GitHub will recognize a change in the repository and ask you to commit (or in other words, it asks you if you want to update the folder you just added the file to).

It's really important to be short but descriptive when you make commits because you'll likely forget what stuff you changed and what version you might want to go back to. Also it helps when you're collaborating so other people know what changes to look for when they read your code. 

Go ahead and fill out the commit descriptions and click commit. 

Adding this file can be considered your first commit. So congratulations, you have successfully made your first commit! 

*protip: On GitHub.com, you can comment on others' (and your own) commits.*

### Your next Commits
After making your first commit, you're going to want to make more changes to your files and repositories. This is when magic things happen, but magic isn't always beautiful.

Like mentioned before, GitHub will recognize the changes you make in your repositories. What's great about GitHub is that it makes it clear which things were removed, changed, and added.

You
 can review the changes that were made before you commit. If you see something that shouldn't be there, you can go back to your code and fix what needs to be fixed before you commit. 

**BRANCHING**

A very important concept of source control is BRANCHING.

Let's say that you have this awesome idea for a new layout but you're not sure how exactly everything is going to work so you want to start a new version from what you have so far (or maybe a completely new version of the project). This is called "branching" because you're branching off and going another direction but you still have the path to go back to where you came from.
