## The Guide to Git 

### About This Workshop
This workshop is intended for people whore don't know anything about source control in general. The main focus of this workshop is to get you to be familiar with the general concept of source control. We are just using Git as an example, so this workshop does NOT cover how Git works in depth. You will learn basic source control concepts such as committing, pushing, merging, etc. in the context of Git but they are more or less the same in other source control systems such as Subversion and Bazaar.
